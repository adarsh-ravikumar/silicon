# Silicon

An environment for building and simulating digital computers. 

It supports the HDL, test scripts, and compare files defined in the [Nand2Tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org), allowing existing hardware designs to be executed in a custom-built simulator.

The goal of Silicon is to implement the complete simulation stack independently while remaining compatible with the established Nand2Tetris hardware specification.
